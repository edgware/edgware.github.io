### What hardware/software do I need to run Edgware?

Edgware can be run on Windows, Linux and OS X systems. It is designed to be lightweight, with a small memory footprint, and will comfortably run on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org).

The development of Edgware solutions can also be carried out on a system running Windows, Linux or OS X. See the Edgware Web site for the [current list](getting_started/prereqs.html) of distros and versions that have been tested.

### Who would be most interested in using Edgware?

Edgware will be of interest to researchers, designers, implementers, and integrators of M2M solutions.

Typical examples include distributed sensor network systems in domains such as:

**Environmental:** environmental concerns and regulations are driving the increased use of sensors for applications monitoring aspects such as water levels and flooding, pollution, and wildlife.

**Industrial:** industry makes extensive use of sensors and actuators combined with analytics to monitor and manage plant, optimize process control, and reduce costs.

**Commercial:** sensors are increasingly being used to track the movement of goods and assets as part of distributed supply chain management processes.

**Medical:** the use of integrated multi-modal sensors for applications such as remote patient monitoring (e.g., the ability to monitor patients in their own homes) will have a dramatic impact on health care delivery.

### I'm a researcher, how can I use Edgware?

Edgware can be used to bridge the worlds of simulators and fielded systems. Using Edgware it is very easy to simulate and/or emulate live systems, and replay pre-recorded telemetry for experimental use, making it ideal as a research platform that offers a high degree of fidelity with fielded systems (indeed it is such a system).

Many technologies, techniques, and algorithms can be easily integrated with Edgware providing significant opportunities for experimentation, evaluation, and an accelerated route to use in the field.

### Is Edgware designed to work with specific hardware (e.g. sensors, actuators, and other devices)?

One of the goals of Edgware is its easy incorporation into existing solutions and network infrastructures, where it adds value by enhancing the integration between components, increasing their utility and enabling new applications and services to be created. As such, Edgware is designed to make the integration of existing devices onto the bus as simple and flexible as possible.

### Do I need a set of devices to start using Edgware?

No. Devices attached to Edgware can either be real hardware or software simulations. This makes it a powerful development and test infrastructure for developing new types of solution.

Real and simulated devices can be mixed in an Edgware installation. Simulated devices can generate artificial data or replay previously recorded data.

Moreover, Edgware is effectively a lightweight, agile, service bus and it has been used in solutions outside of M2M that take advantage of just those qualities.

### Edgware is middleware that connects distributed systems; do I need multiple system to run it?

No. You can emulate a set of distributed nodes and devices on a single system. This is particularly useful for development and demonstration purposes.

### OK, so how do I get started?

Everything that you need to know - installation, configuration, and development - is included in the documentation that accompanies Edgware.
